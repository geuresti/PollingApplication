Hello Professor Laventon,

The Galaxy Team and I have decided that the best way to power the new power plant
is through the use of Voltorbs, as they can cleanly produce electricity.

We have to consider how many voltorbs we will need to sufficiently power the 
village. We have to consider how much power is required for Jubilife, the 
largest city in the Sinnoh region. 

Once we have that figure, we will next need to determine rate at which a 
Voltorb can produce electricity, as well as whether they need breaks or time 
to recharge. 

After we have that, we can determine the minimum number needed to keep the city 
powered. The next step is sending out members of the Galaxy Team to capture 
Voltorbs from the Sacred Plaza, the only place Voltorbs can be found.

The final step would be setting up stations where Voltorbs can be placed that
will harness their electricity and use it to power the village. Luckily, we 
have the measurements for an average voltorb: 0.5m, 10.4kg.

The powerplant will have to be built with enough of these stations to accomodate
all the Voltorbs. Additionally, I would recommend space for extra Voltorbs
to be housed as a contingency plan in case we ever need to replace a Voltorb or
just to give them breaks by swapping out Voltorbs over time.
